# Data-To-Decision
This project aims to bridge this gap by applying 
data science techniques to analyse sales trends, segment customers, and 
build predictive models for improved marketing strategies and customer 
retention. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, businesses 
can gain actionable insights, enhance customer engagement, and improve 
overall efficiency. The project will also develop visualization tools to help 
stakeholders interpret complex data easily, facilitating better strategic 
decisions.
